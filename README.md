# A fork from jbehley's octree(including the test data)

- build with vcpkg installed Boost:
```
cmake -B .\build\ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:PATH=C:/DevTools/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
```


# Efficient Radius Neighbor Search in Three-dimensional Point Clouds

This repository provides the Octree implementation of the paper "Efficient Radius Neighbor Search in Three-dimensional Point Clouds" by J. Behley, V. Steinhage, and A.B. Cremers, University of Bonn presented at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2015.


## Features
- Fast radius neighbor search for three-dimensional point clouds.
- Fully templated for maximal flexibility to support arbitrary point representations & containers
- Supports arbitrary p-norms: L1, L2 and Maximum norm included.
- Nearest neighbor search with arbitrary norms (added 25. November 2015).

## Building the examples & tests

The octree itself has no dependencies. 
However, for compiling the examples, you need [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and [Boost C++ library](http://www.boost.org/).
For building the examples you have to first build the project:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To run the examples, you need some point cloud data:

```bash
wget http://jbehley.github.io/data/wachtberg_folds.zip
unzip wachtberg_folds.zip -d data
```

Now you can run the examples:

```bash
./example1 data/scan_001_points.dat
```

which perform some queries and demonstrate the flexibility of our Octree implementation to handle different implementations of points.

The different examples show some use cases of the octree. `example1` demonstrates the general usage with point data types providing public access to x,y,z coordinates. `example2` shows how to use a different point type, which non-public coordinates. `example3` shows how to use the templated method inside an also templated descriptor.

We also provide a test case using the [Google Test Framework (GTest)](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/), which is automatically build if the package is either found by Cmake or in the corresponding source directory, e.g., /usr/src/gtest/.
You can invoke the testsuite with

```bash
./octree-test
```
